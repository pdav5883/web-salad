    <p>Salad Bowl is a three-round game where two teams take turns trying to guess words/phrases that the participants have come up with. Whoever's turn it is (i.e. the clue-giver) will see a sequence of words/phrases, and their team will be guessing while the other team is waiting patiently.</p>

    <p class="nextpar">If a team correctly guesses a word, they get a point. If the clue-giver messes up, then the other team gets a point.</p>
    
    <p class="nextpar">The three rounds:</p>
    <ul class="nextpar">
      <li><strong>Round 1</strong>: The clue-giver can say anything to get her team to guess the word/phrase, <em>except</em> for the actual word(s) in the answer. For example: if the word was "Applesauce" and the clue-giver said "It's sauce made from apples", that would be a point for the other team. Different tenses, singular/plural, and rhymes-with are also no good.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 2</strong>: The clue-giver is playing charades to get his team to guess the word.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 3</strong>: The clue-giver can say <em>one word</em> to get her team to guess the answer. It sounds hard, but since everyone has seen all the words in the two previous rounds, it's not bad. If you want, you can allow the clue-giver to say a second word after ~10 seconds of waiting if her team isn't getting the answer.</li>
